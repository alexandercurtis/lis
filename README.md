# lis - Longest Increasing Subsequence

The longest increasing subsequence in a sequence is the longest sequence of elements X[i] in a sequence X, such that
each element is greater than the previous, and the length of the subsequence is as long as possible. There may be more 
than one such sequence.

For example, longest increasing subsequences of the characters H,E,L,L,O,W,O,R,L,D include E,L,O,R and H,L,O,W.

Similarly:

    ABCDE -> ABCDE
  
    VAWBXCYDZ -> VWXYZ
